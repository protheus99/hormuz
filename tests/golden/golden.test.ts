// Golden replay (spec §14.6): is the engine still bit-reproducible?
//
// If this fails after a deliberate change to engine behavior, check the change is intended, then
// update the hashes below in the same commit and say so in the commit message. If it fails with no
// intended change, something has become nondeterministic — find it before going further.
// To find the first day two runs disagree, compare `daily`, then diff that day's state using the
// `inspect` callback of runGoldenReplay.

// S0 through the real tick orchestrator, re-recorded in Node 24 on 2026-09-26 when the economic
// climate was renamed from `weather` - so that weather could mean the sea. The fingerprint hashes
// object *keys* as well as values, so renaming one field changes every hash while changing nothing
// about the run: fills (1,163), barrels refined (7,524,399.23892715) and fees ($587,178,684.2656597)
// are identical to the last decimal on both sides of it, which is what says this was only a rename.
// Last verified identical in Chrome 152 (`npm run golden:browser`) on 2026-09-19; re-check in a
// browser at the end of each phase.
